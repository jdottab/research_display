                            A certain field of study, Web Accessibility, 
                            looks at how people perceive, comprehend, navigate, 
                            interact, and contribute to the Web regardless of 
                            age or ability. We needed to have tools that would be able 
                            to check if the websites would conform to 
                            the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, 
                            WCAG 2.0 (levels A, AA, and AAA) and 
                            provide to us what the violations were, if any, 
                            clearly. We also needed to choose tools 
                            that were accurate, fast, and easily accessible 
                            to others. Using these pretenses, we chose these 
                            accessibility tools: AChecker, Total Validator, 
                            Wave, and HTML and CSS validation.

                            We asked ChatGPT for 15 job finding websites and it gave us 15 websites. 
                            However, one of the websites that ChatGPT had listed was 
                            a duplicate, simplyhired.com, so we added another job application website 
                            handshake.com to make 15.

                            We used Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 
                            instead of the newer WCAG 2.1 because nothing changed 
                            between the versions for what we were testing. We also 
                            did not use WCAG 2.2 because it is being released in the 
                            third quarter of 2023 and the testing occurred in the 
                            beginning to mid-July of 2023. We needed to have tools 
                            that would be able to check if the websites would conform 
                            to the WCAG 2.0 (levels A, AA, and AAA) and provide to us 
                            what the violations were, if any, clearly. We also needed

                            AChecker checks the conformance of the HTML page against 
                            difference accessibility standards, including WCAG 2.0. 
                            We test each page against WCAG 2.0 in 3 different levels: 
                            low (A), the most common or mid (AA), and high (AAA). 
                            The report will sort the errors into 3 different categories: 
                            Known problems, Likely problems, and Potential problems. 
                            We check how many errors there are in each category 
                            for each level and then analyze the first category, 
                            known problems, for the first 2 levels, A and AA. To analyze 
                            the errors, we separated them into 4 different categories 
                            based on what principles they violate: perceivable, 
                            operable, understandable, and robust.

                            Total Validator tests if the HTML of the websites 
                            conform it WCAG and Section 508 on three different 
                            levels: A, AA, and AAA. The WAVE tool checks the websites 
                            for errors, alerts, features, and issues with the structure 
                            of the website, as well as problems with the use of HTML5, 
                            accessible rich internet application (ARIA), and contrast 
                            errors that are based on the low and mid levels of WCAG 2.0 
                            and Section 508.

                            HTML and CSS evaluations compare

                            tandards and see if the websites are conforming to them. 
                            To do these tests, we used the W3C's free online 
                            HTML Markup Validation Service and CSS Validator Service.

                            Using all of the different tools, AChecker, Total Validator, 
                            WAVE, and HTML and CSS validators, we conducted only one round 
                            of testing on the job hunting websites using Google Chrome on 
                            a Dell laptop running Windows 10. AChecker and Total Validator 
                            were tested against levels A, AA, and AAA of WCAG 2.0 and the 
                            WAVE tool was tested against levels A and AA of WCAG 2.0 and 
                            Section 508. The results of these tests will be presented in 
                            the following pages.
